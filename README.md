# BA-Source-Dump

- Dump BA Source Data using Il2CppInspectorRedux.
- Keep track of the latest config/resource/dump.
- Also dump FBS data.

This workflow runs every weekday at 03:00, 05:00, 07:00, 09:00 UTC.
And runs everyday at 07:00

## Info
- Apparently Il2CppDumper doesn't dump correctly on JP 1.58
- Using Cpp2IL dump correctly, but cannot dump FBS data, due to missing RVA on the dump.
